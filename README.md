TRAIN COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM: 

The main aim of this project is to avoid train collisions by a simple Verilog code that can prevent a huge property and life loss.


INTRODUCTION: 

Train accidents may occur due to cracks on railway track or due to short circuiting or ineffective Train Traffic Control System that is failing to find the train approaching in opposite direction on the same track leading to collision. In our project we are implementing the train collision avoidance system using Verilog programming language. To implement this program, we use software called XILINX ISE for synthesizing and analyzing of HDL designs. 


ABSTRACT:

Train accidents occur mainly due to cracks in the track, human errors and due to lack of communication between the trains and irregularity of Train Traffic Control System. When the train meets with the accident lot of people lose their lives and huge amount of railway property is destroyed and it also takes lot of time to hold back to the normal situations. Most of the accidents happen due to human error. Normally to prevent these accidents we place sensors on either side of the platform to identify the train at right time and to receive traffic signals at the platform properly. Here we came with some different approach which is easy to manage and implement and cost effective. Normally collision occurs when two trains approaching in opposite directions on same track. So, if we manage to prevent two trains travel on the same track then collision can be avoided. Here in this project we have implemented Verilog code to solve this problem. The purpose of this project is to write a Verilog code to detect the opposite train and deviate the train based on priority of the trains thus avoiding collision.
